  <p>Welcome to my webpage about me here you can find some personal information about me and my goals.I am generally an introverted person but I have no problem with working in a team on projects or work. One of my goals in life is travel as much as I can. The world is a big place and I would like to see as much of it as I can. </p>
  <p> This program is helping me learn a lot about a topic I never thought I would be interested in. I originally wanted to break into the archietecture field but ended up decided it was not for me. I have always been interested in tech and coding but never found a way to break into that field. This progam has given me the chance to explore this field. Linked at the bottom you can find my steam page as if I am not busy with this program or work etc I am most likely gaming. I would love to design websites for some of my favorite games or even maybe build my own some day. </p>
